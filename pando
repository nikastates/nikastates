try to wash from the limbs of the poplar
the ruts of some cotton, some hemp
men come often to stand in its shadow
some easy, some vigilant
what do we know about land?
what do we know about land?

cut four faces, shake down six grandfathers
cry for the lost cataract
and give new names to the butte and the mesa
in honor, in contempt
what do we know about land?
what do we know about land?

All the agents of loss, they have loud names
so tell me yours
i’ve been an agent of loss, of no place
tell me yours

some deliver their children to tire
in the bath of the forest, in brume
worry lodged in vague footing, lost fire
the slithering path, the small tooth
What do we know about you?
What do we know about you?

is the damp in the crook of mountain
a faithful, and quiet wet
or a caul over the face of pursuit,
and the map made more perilous?
What do we know about land?
What do we know about land?

All the agents of loss, they have loud names
so tell me yours
i’ve been an agent of loss, of no place
tell me yours

there was my love in the shivering center
the last breadth of the longest-lived tree
she said ”There’s moment of inchoate wonder
buried somewhere beneath my grief.
What do they know about me?
What do they know about me?”
